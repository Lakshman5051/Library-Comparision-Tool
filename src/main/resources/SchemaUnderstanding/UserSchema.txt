/**
 * STEP 2B: UserRole Entity (Join Table)

 * Why a separate entity?
 * - Allows one user to have multiple roles

 /**
  * STEP 3: Project Entity
  * This represents a user's project (e.g., "E-commerce Website")

  /**
   * STEP 4: ProjectLibrary Entity (Join Table)
   * This is THE KEY to linking projects and libraries!
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS:
   * - A project can have MANY libraries (React, Express, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   * - A library can be in MANY projects (React is used by 1000s of projects)
   * - This is a MANY-TO-MANY relationship
   * - We need a join table to connect them
   *
   * BONUS: We can add extra data about the relationship:
   * - When was this library added to the project?
   * - Is it required or optional?
   * - Any notes about why it's included?

   /**
    * STEP 5: Favorite Entity (Join Table)

    * RELATIONSHIP:
    * - A user can favorite MANY libraries
    * - A library can be favorited by MANY users
    * - This is MANY-TO-MANY
    *
    * EXAMPLE:
    * - User "John" favorites: React, Express, PostgreSQL
    * - User "Sarah" favorites: React, Vue, MongoDB
    * - React is favorited by both John and Sarah
